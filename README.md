# Getting back into studying and practicing
This started as a tutorial, but now I'm expanding on it's functionality for more practice and to learn Axios and GraphQL a bit more. The goal of the webapp is for faculty to be able register students and assign them to a teacher. 
<p>There will be two kinds of user accounts, faculty and teachers. Students will be able to input their roll number and see the teacher they're assigned to.<p>
